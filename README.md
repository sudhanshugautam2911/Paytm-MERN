# Primarily focused on backend technologies with minimal emphasis on UI, the project concentrated on implementing robust and efficient transaction mechanisms.

## Synchronization and Concurrency
Locking Mechanisms: Use database locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
Optimistic Locking: Implement versioning to handle concurrent data modifications.
Pessimistic Locking: Lock records during transactions to prevent conflicts.

## Database Management
MongoDB: Utilize MongoDB for storing user data, transaction histories, etc.
Indexing: Ensure efficient querying by indexing frequently accessed fields.
Data Replication and Sharding: Implement for scalability and high availability

## User Authentication and Authorization
OAuth2.0 / JWT: Implement token-based authentication to secure user sessions.
